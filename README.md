### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the techinicall assignment for the QA role at **Pipefy** - which uses **Cypress** for the E2E test cases.

### Assignment Status
<ul>
  <li> <b>Web E2E</b><br>Test cases failing: Page locators kept changing and I was not able to find solid locators that would work despite how the UI looked</li>
  Tests were running properly and included the list bellow - but then got flaky:  <br>
  	âœ“ Non mandatory fields <br>
  	âœ“ mandatory fields  <br>
  	âœ“ Page Object  <br>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Backend</b><br> Project not included: I was not able to fully understand how to setup queries/mutations using GraphQL in time </li>
</ul>
